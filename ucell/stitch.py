"""Raster-order, chunk-wise instance segmentation that fits in bounded memory.

This is the pure orchestration layer for processing a (potentially
larger-than-memory) image in overlapping tiles and emitting a single, globally
consistent label mask -- without ever holding the whole image or the whole
output. It has no torch / tensor-server / GPU dependencies: model inference and
output upload are supplied as callbacks, so the linking logic can be
unit-tested on synthetic destination fields.

Cross-chunk ID consistency (the hard part)
------------------------------------------
Every foreground pixel's flow integrates to a *destination* ~ its cell center
(see :mod:`ucell.dynamics_local`). Two pixels are the same cell iff they share a
destination. We keep a small, pruned set of already-discovered
``(global_destination, id)`` pairs. When a tile is clustered, the in-bounds
known destinations are *injected* as seeds carrying their IDs; any cluster that
lands on an injected seed inherits that ID. So a cell straddling a border is
discovered once, and every later tile that sees it reuses the same ID -- no
re-reading of saved labels, no union-find, no rewrite pass.

This works regardless of which tile's core contains the cell center, provided
``margin >= max cell diameter`` so that every tile whose core touches a cell
contains the *whole* cell and therefore computes the same destination.

Memory: the known-destination set is pruned to a band near the processing
frontier (one entry per boundary cell in that band, never per cell in the
image), so it stays bounded for arbitrarily large images.
