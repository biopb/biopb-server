"""Local, GPU-free fork of the pieces of ``ucell.dynamics`` needed for
chunk-wise (lazy) segmentation.

Why this exists
---------------
``ucell.dynamics`` lives only in the ucell ML image, imports ``torch`` /
``fastremap`` (absent from the dev venv), and its public ``compute_masks``
discards the per-pixel *destination* map that cross-chunk stitching depends on.
This module re-implements just two steps in pure numpy/scipy so the logic is
importable and unit-testable without Docker or a GPU:

1. ``follow_flows`` -- Euler integration of the flow field, returning the final
   location ("destination", ~cell center) of every foreground pixel. The torch
   version normalises coordinates to [-1, 1] and grid-samples; algebra shows one
   step is simply ``p += dP(p)`` in pixel units with edge-clamping, which is what
   we do here via ``scipy.ndimage.map_coordinates`` (bilinear).
2. ``cluster_destinations`` -- the "light clustering" that turns the (noisy,
   spread-over-a-few-pixels) destinations into one label per cell: histogram the
   destinations, pick peaks as seeds, grow each seed, then label every pixel by
   the seed its destination fell into. This mirrors ``get_masks_torch``.

``cluster_destinations`` additionally accepts **injected seeds** carrying IDs
from previously processed chunks. A cluster that lands on an injected seed
inherits that ID -- this is the mechanism that keeps instance IDs consistent
across chunk borders without re-reading saved labels.

Constants (rpad=20, kernel 5 for peak detection, h>10, 11^ndim seed window,
``h>2`` growth, 5 growth iters, ``max_size_fraction``) match the upstream
``get_masks_torch`` so per-chunk behaviour stays close to the original. The QC
step (``remove_bad_flow_masks``) is intentionally omitted: the server calls
``compute_masks`` with ``flow_threshold=0``, so it is a no-op.
